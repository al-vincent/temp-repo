"Dear Sir/Madam, Greetings. My name is .I reside in Kenya  City Mombasa and Location Kilifi County. Am the Director @Gevicoml Limited with a mother Company called ProGow Limited.  I Specifically deal with export  of Spices  and other Fresh and dried produce as well am a farmer . Am also producing Gluten free Cassava flour for export . With thanks received your correspondence and I appreciate for UK Growth Gateway giving us an ear to our issues as we venture to develop our country and  create  new market opportunities in Europe. However i do export to Europe and i have not shipped to UK , UK has strict rules in terms of documentation pass for fresh produce of which  to us small scale  business ventures  feel exempted to ship to UK. Am interested to do shipment of fresh Produce to UK ,Kindly  how i can get reliable customers of both fresh and dried Produce? When i was joining this forum  my big concern were  how to get financial investor for my business  so as i can manage to farm more and use organically methods of drying as well packaging .Due to high demand  i have realised that if we  use modern methods buyers are likely more adaptable to  them .Please guide me on how to get an investor from UK who can finance my proposal . There are so many problems in exporting Some fresh produce  and over the last year i have tried to mitigate some ,like most fresh produce spoil at unloading and this has  made me stop exporting and look for new modern methods of packaging of which the produce can stay fresh over several months (Pickled )  containerization .This market of fresh produce on pickled containers has not been worked upon,am looking to invest and market prickled Spices( Red and Green Chilli,Okra and Garlic) and fresh fruits  to UK  . Let me know how i can get assistance on the market of Prickled  fresh Produce and Dried gluten free Cassava The above are my main areas and I hope to get  positive reply . Thank You."

"Dear colleagues, I hope this finds you well, We have been contacted by a company based in Madagascar called 'Les Gambas de l`Ankarana', whose main activities are the breeding - processing and export of raw frozen organic shrimps, of Madagascar origin. They have customers in the UK, but their Distribution Centre is in France, so their products go from Paris to the UK. Now that Brexit is in force, they want advice on how to get their products into the UK without paying customs duties: 1/- Which certificate of origin form should they use? 2/- Their products are put in 20' reefers at a temperature of -25°C, most of the load is for France and a small part is for the UK. What is the possible solution to ensure that products, once landed in France and taken out of the container, re-routed by refrigerated lorry to the UK from France, can enter the UK duty free? Grateful if you can advise us on this matter Many thanks, "

"Thank you for this opportunity to share with you our plans and projections in order to grow our entity through the avenues available for African businesses. Our company is Continuum Multiservices Global Enterprises, we can be categorized as a startup. We are based in Nigeria and we process cassava into stable foods in Nigeria. However there is a huge gap in the supply of cassava derivatives in Nigeria despite being the largest grower of cassava tubers in the world at 60Million Tonnes in a year. But ironically we also import about $600Million dollars of cassava derivatives in a year.  Our company is trying to bridge this gap by expanding our capacity to be able to play in this sector. I will be more than glad to collaborate or hear about services that can be rendered for our scaling up program. Thank you "
"Hello, Subsequent upon receiving an auto reply acknowledging my email. I find it necessary to add the following information; I am in the agribusiness sector. Our export plans include supplying UK with High Quality Cassava Flour because of its gluten free component which is gaining high demand in the food sector. Market is huge, even locally in Nigeria as stated in my earlier mail and we are hoping to increase factory capacity as well as lay a solid foundation in the adoption of climate smart Agriculture practices because the major raw material is cassava which contributes to the GHG emissions.  We have not been in contact with any UK Government services, however we are in discussion with a machinery fabricator in UK. We need help in the area of capacity building, technological transfer, grant or funding. We are registered member of African Investment Conference and we received a mail from Growth gateway. Thank you. "

"Dear Rt Hon Williamson, I just took a call from my local partners in Somaliland. They are very humbled by your visit and interest in improving their lives . They look at things differently to how we do in UK , given their lives are often spent in real abject poverty , while they strive to maintain their pride and a sense of their place in the world. May I please again refer you to my message below . Given Somaliland's inability to be recognised as a sovereign state, our project is unable to attract the funding we need to progress in the manner we need to ,in order to illustrate what your sincere words mean . The CDC are unwilling to support our project ,stating their policy is not to allow investment into extractive industries. We need access to outher financial instruments which HM Govt alone can provide . Somaliland has natural resources to exploit ,not least in our project area where we enjoy unanimous support from the local population and their leadership . Please can you assist, we do not want a free ride, far from it , we are more than happy to give relevant undertakings to obtain access to funding . Our Sahmin project is a generation long , will bring long term positive change to local Somalilanders lives, also simultaneously benefitting Anglo Somalilanders resident in the UK , while just as importantly illustrating that we as a country still can positively influence lives for the long term , producing key metal units in mineral which the UK will need to meet future powergen demands . Our intention is to reinvest to broaden the project model to include harnessing renewable solar and hydro power sources, while expanding the basic agricultural and fisheries industries. Our project is strategically positioned both gegoraphy and geologically , can provide extra benefits by digging wells and installing bespoke desalination facilities to meet the needs created by the drought conditions blighting the region ." 
"Dear Growth Gateway Team, Thank you for your email below and for this great opportunity for possible support! One of our businesses; Dear Rae, a jewellery business based in Cape Town, South Africa has been on a very aggressive growth strategy. As a luxury good company, we have acknowledged that the South African market is not mature enough to support our growth and that we need to focus on growing the business in mature markets such as the UK, US and Europe. Prior to COVID-19 disruptions in 2019, we used to have great exposure from the UK & European Markets, so we focused on taking our business digital, to be able to serve global customers from the comfort of their screens wherever they are in the world. Of course this was a great foresight, so when the world paused, we could still be in touch with our existing customers and  were able to attract new customers. This led us to open a fulfilment centre in Feb 2021 in  the UK so that we can use it as a base to serve customers based in the UK and Europe easier, coincidentally, the US market also tapped in the services based in the UK. We since have conducted some popups in collaboration with other brands in London and have received a great reception. This of course has now comfortably let us, organically, to open a physical retail store in the UK so that we can really make an impact. For the company to make a big impact and be a sustainable growth, we need investment. We have managed to navigate all other items such as importing licenses, etc and now just need to focus on growth so we can serve the UK & European markets.Our need is interaction to investment arms, finance homes, grants etc so that we can pursue funding opportunity. For your information, have a glance at our Website:  https://dearraeworld.com"
