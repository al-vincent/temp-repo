Due to high demand i have realised that if we use modern methods buyers are likely more adaptable to them .   Please guide me on how to get an investor from UK who can finance my proposal .   There are so many problems in exporting Some fresh produce and over the last year i have tried to mitigatesome , like most fresh produce spoil at unloading and this has made me stop exporting and look for new modern methods of packaging of which the produce can stay fresh over several months (Pickled ) containerization .  This market of fresh produce on pickled containers has not been worked upon, am looking to invest and market prickled Spices( Red and Green Chilli, Okra and Garlic) and fresh fruits to UK .

As a luxury good company,  we have acknowledged that the South African market is not mature enough to support our growth and that we need to focus on growing the business in mature markets such as the UK,  US and Europe.  Prior to COVID-19 disruptions in 2019,  we used to have great exposure from the UK & European Markets,  so we focused on taking our business digital,  to be able to serve global customers from the comfort of their screens wherever they are in the world.   Of course this was a great foresight,  so when the world paused,  we could still be in touch with our existing customers and were able to attract new customers.  This led us to open a fulfilment centre in Feb 2021 in the UK so that we can use it as a base to serve customers based in the UK and Europe easier,  coincidentally,  the US market also tapped in the services based in the UK.  We since have conducted some popups in collaboration with other brands in London and have received a great reception.

        "query": "To whom it may concern,  I attended the Africa Investment Conference representing a different organisation however,  by attending the conference I became aware that Growth Gateway could perhaps assist with a project that I am assisting another company with.  The company Heever Tech Pty Ltd is a South African start-up company that owns its own IP for the recycling of waste tyres (polymers) of all sizes including the large mine type tyres.  Our technology is neither a Pyrolysis nor Gasification; it is HEEVER TECHNOLOGY.  It is a Rubber (Polymer) Recycling Technology that enables the semi-devulcanisation of rubber into a malleable rubber,  yet preserves the crosslinks,  maintaining the molecular mass and specific gravity in tolerance,  thereby enabling the malleable polymers to be re-compounded and revulcanised to manufacture an array of rubber products,  as well as enables the use of by-products to generate energy related by-products such as hydro carbon fuel.  The technology is a unique and efficient recycling solution that solves the tyre and polymer recycling challenge and complies with the attributes of zero waste and circular economy by the processing of the malleable rubber and energy related by-products,  thereby developing new industries,  jobs and products.  None of the other technologies have the unique differentiating factor and advantage that the HeeverTech technologies has.  All other technologies require that the waste tyres must be shredded then reduced to crumb rubber,  prior to being used in their processes.  HeeverTech technology is therefore more efficient,  effective and economical as we immerse the complete or whole tyre into a purpose designed reactor which then reduces the tyre into a malleable rubber as well as enables the extraction of energy related by-products,  all in one process.  We believe that in order to achieve a circular economy one has to have the three elements which are the technology,  the recycling capability as well as a manufacturing (or processing) capability.  Without all three elements one just has a recycling capability that can't pay for itself over the medium to long-term.  Our business development strategy is to be selective with whom we associate in order to reduce the likelihood of unethical interest,  as occurs with website enquiries,  and thus the reason for approaching Growth Gateway instead.  We are open to the development of this capability in the United Kingdom as well as where United Kingdom companies might want to become involved in South Africa for eventual international expansion.  Your guidance and advice as to how HeeverTech could proceed,  either with or without Growth Gateway,  would be appreciated. "

Due to the cholera crisis in zim in 2008 and the global financial crisis in 2009 I had to pull out of exports as the prices became unviable.

I seek a partner to help me with the trellessing and netting of the same and then expand on the plantations.

        "query": "Dear Growth Gateway Team In response to your mail below.   Thank you for the opportunity to participate in your investment conference and this correspondence.  In response of your question bear in mind that besides South Africa,  the rest of Africa has only 3 economic sectors : agriculture,  mining and tourism.   So I would argue the chance of African investors/companies coming to invest in the UK would be very small considering that investment capital in Africa is short.  I that respect I would argue that you need to take a holistic approach and decide whether you want to approach this from a push or pull perspective or both at the same time.  Example : the agriculture groups here are looking for funding to expand operations and increase processing ,  do value adding.   A UK investor sees the opportunity to invest (either just for a return on investment) which may have to opportunity of export services/equipment from the UK.   The investor will most likely be involved in such sector in the UK/EU and may invest for purposes of getting more product (increase trade).   But it increases production or  the value chain and distribution to the benefit of both parties.   So for Africa it would be more of a 'partnership' if the UK wishes to reap larger rewards in turn of increase in trade or return on investments.  If you support this wider view of collaboration to the benefit of both parties.  Herewith our information.  DevAfrique is a company acting as transaction advisors and facilitators,  focussing on impact investment opportunities in Sub- Sahara Africa.  Our Chief Investment Officer had been responsible to find new investment opportunities for the largest investment group in Africa and perhaps has the most experience in assessing and structuring deals and projects across the African continent for the largest investors.  As you know Africa is the only place that investors can still get good returns on their investment.   Hence the US are starting to focus more also on the region.  Attached please find,  Presentation intro (Corporate Services we offer).  Our Business Model Our business model work on the basis that we represent the investor and will sign such agreement with the investor.  We would like to understand the investor's requirements,  budget and minimum return on investment,  that will enable us to identify or build project(s) that will meet the investor requirements.  We have access to most projects in the region and the ability to build new projects  to meet investor requirements.  Conclusion : We are looking to build long-term relationships with a group of serious investors that are able to pursue the opportunities that we have access to.  Prosper Africa has the 'virtual deals room'.   However in our experience investors would like to have the first bite at a opportunity and not bid against other investors for an opportunity.  Request :  Are you able to assist us with introduction to UK investors that may share the same idea/strategy? Kind Regards"
