["Well i'm not sure about the story nad it did seem biased. What\nI disagree with is your statement that the U.S. Media is out to\nruin Israels reputation. That is rediculous. The U.S. media is\nthe most pro-israeli media in the world. Having lived in Europe\nI realize that incidences such as the one described in the\nletter have occured. The U.S. media as a whole seem to try to\nignore them. The U.S. is subsidizing Israels existance and the\nEuropeans are not (at least not to the same degree). So I think\nthat might be a reason they report more clearly on the\natrocities.\n\tWhat is a shame is that in Austria, daily reports of\nthe inhuman acts commited by Israeli soldiers and the blessing\nreceived from the Government makes some of the Holocaust guilt\ngo away. After all, look how the Jews are treating other races\nwhen they got power. It is unfortunate.\n", "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYeah, do you expect people to read the FAQ, etc. and actually accept hard\natheism?

You might have to start asking the\nsame sort of questions of Arab countries as well.  You realize it\nwould not work, as the Arab countries' treatment of Jews over the\nlast several decades is so bad that your fixation on Israel would\nbegin to look like the biased attack that it is.\n\n   Everyone in this group recognizes that your stupid 'Center for\nPolicy Research' is nothing more than a fancy name for some bigot\nwho hates Israel.", "Notwithstanding all the legitimate fuss about this proposal, how much\nof a change is it?

I have a record that shows a IIsi with and without a 64KB cache.\nIt's small enough that I will attach it.\n\nI have also measured some real programs with and without the 64 KB\ncache.  The speedup varies a lot from app to app, ranging from 0% to\n40%.  I think an average of 20%-25% is about right.  The subjective\ndifference is not great, but is sometimes noticable.

That is interesting. Not to mention thought\nprovoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His\nchildren. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand\nuntil we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the\nfinal measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is\nthe final test.\nSpecifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven\nand one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go\nto one or the other. The \"grading\" on a pass/fail basis is done by God\nthe Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only\nGod sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, \"...who can know it.\" I\nwould say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method.\nThat is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain\nand ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and\ntomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part\nof the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly\nwouldn't be going to Heaven.

DH allows both ends to agree on\na session key which they use with symmetric cryptography (something\nlike DES) for the encryption.\n\nHow could the \"back door\" keys work in this system?  I can see a few\npossibilities.  One is that the DH-like algorithm has the property that\nthe session key can be deduced by an eavesdropper who knows the back door\nkeys for one (or possibly both) communicants.  Perhaps the random numbers\nused in the DH are seeded by the back door key, or some such.\n\nAnother possibility, as was suggested here earlier, is that the chips\nsimply broadcast the session key, encrypted with the chip's own\ninternal secret key.  In this system the back door keys are secret keys\nusable for decrypting this session key broadcast.  Actually the chip's\nsecret key doesn't need to be a public key in this usage, but can be\nidentical to the secret back-door key.  (This proposal seems most\nstraightforward to me.)\n\nStill another possibility is that the encryption algorithm used for the\nmessage itself has a \"dual key\" property, that possession of either of\ntwo keys can be used to decrypt it.  One key would be the session key from\nthe DH exchange, and the other would be the back door key for the chip.\n\nIt's worth noting that one of the proposals Dorothy Denning raised\nduring her amazingly prescient on-line discussion last November and\nDecember was a variation on Diffie-Hellman in which a third party would\nparticipate in deriving the session keys.  This doesn't quite fit into\nwhat we know of how Clipper works but it hints that those who had early\nknowledge of Clipper (or whose thinking was somehow synchronized with\nClipper designers) may have had Diffie-Hellman on their minds.", "GAME(S) OF 4/15\n---------------\nADIRONDACK 6\tCDI 2\t(Adirondack leads series, 1-0)\n\n=================================================\t\t\t\nFIRST ROUND\t\t\t\t\t\nSpringfield Indians vs Providence Bruins\nGm 1:\tSpringfield 3\tPROVIDENCE 2\t\nGm 2:\tSpringfield 5\tPROVIDENCE 4\nGm 3:\t4/16\tProvidence at Springfield\nGm 4:\t4/17\tProvidence at Springfield\nGm 5:\t4/22\tSpringfield at Providence\t*\nGm 6:\t4/24\tProvidence at Springfield\t*\nGm 7:\t4/27\tSpringfield at Providence\t*\n\nCD Islanders vs Adirondack Red Wings\nGm 1:\tADIRONDACK 6\tCDI 2\nGm 2:\t4/17\tCDI at Adirondack\nGm 3:\t4/18\tAdirondack at CDI\nGm 4:\t4/21\tAdirondack at CDI\nGm 5:\t4/23\tCDI at Adirondack\t*\nGm 6:\t4/24\tAdirondack at CDI\t*\nGm 7:\t4/26\tCDI at Adirondack\t*\n\nBaltimore Skipjacks at Binghamton Rangers\nGm 1:\t4/16\tBaltimore at Binghamton\nGm 2:\t4/17\tBaltimore at Binghamton\nGm 3:\t4/23\tBinghamton at Baltimore\nGm 4:\t4/24\tBinghamton at Baltimore\nGm 5:\t4/26\tBaltimore at Binghamton\t*\nGm 6:\t4/28\tBinghmaton at Baltimore\t*\nGm 7:\t4/30\tBaltimore at Binghamton\t*\n\nUtica Devils vs Rochester Americans\nGm 1:\t4/16\tUtica at Rochester\nGm 2:\t4/17\tUtica at Rochester\nGm 3:\t4/20\tRochester at Utica\nGm 4:\t4/22\tRochester at Utica\nGm 5:\t4/24\tUtica at Rochester\t*\nGm 6:\t4/26\tRochester at Utica\t*\nGm 7:\t4/28\tUtica at Rochester\t*\n\nMoncton Hawks vs St John's Maple Leafs\nGm 1:\tSt John's 4\tMoncton 2\nGm 2:\t4/17\tMoncton vs St John's at Halifax\nGm 3:\t4/21\tSt John's at Moncton\nGm 4:\t4/23\tSt John's at Moncton\nGm 5:\t4/26\tMoncton vs St John's at Halifax\t*\nGm 6:\t4/28\tSt John's at Moncton\t\t*\nGm 7:\t4/30\tMoncton vs St John's at Halifax\t*\n\nCape Breton Oilers vs Fredericton Canadiens\nGm 1:\tFredericton 4\tCape Breton 3\t(2OT)\nGm 2:\t4/16\tCape Breton at Fredericton\t\nGm 3:\t4/20\tFredericton at Cape Breton\nGm 4:\t4/22\tFredericton at Cape Breton\nGm 5:\t4/24\tCape Breton at Fredericton\t*\nGm 6:\t4/26\tFredericton at Cape Breton\t*\nGm 7:\t4/28\tCape Breton at Fredericton\t*", "\nYes!

She \nrefered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old \nwould have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed\nto be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.\n\nRCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that\nbeing Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.", "I will try to answer some of Dorin's questions, even though they were\nnot addressed to me specifically, but I feel that I am a bit concerned\nby the thread since I am a Southern Lebanese from a village that is \noften on the receiving end of Israel's bombs.\nIn the first place the death of three soldiers on a patrol in occupied\nLebanese terrritory is NOT an act of terrorism or murder.  It is \ndisingeneous to compare their death to that of athletes in Munich\nor any other act of terrorism or mrder.  This exercise is aimed \nsolely at diverting the issue and is far from the truth.\nIt seems to me, Dorin, that, you are so remote and ignorant of the problem\non the ground that your comments can only be charactrized as irrelevant,\nand heavily colored by the preconceptions and misinformation.\nI will try to paint the most accurate picture I can of\nwhat the situation really is in South Lebanon.\n\n\n\nI am.  I was back in my home village this last summer.  For your information\nwe are PEOPLE, not a bunch of indiscriminate terrorists.  Most of the \npeople in my village are regular inhabitants that go about their daily\nbusiness, some work in the fields, some own small shops, others are\nolder men that go to the coffe shop and drink coffee.  Is that so hard to\nimagine ????  It is NOT a \"terrorist camp\" as you and the Israelis like \nto view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer\nin the streets, women preparing lunch, men playing cards, etc.....\nSOME young men, usually aged between 17 to 30 years are members of\nthe Lebanese resistance.  Even the inhabitants of the village do not \nknow who these are, they are secretive about it, but most people often\nsuspect who they are and what they are up to.  These young men are\nsupported financially by Iran most of the time.  They sneak arms and\nammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps\nfor Israeli patrols.  Every time an Israeli soldier is killed or injured\nby these traps, Israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages\nof their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians.  Once they\nare back they announce that they bombed a \"terrorist  hideout\" where\nan 8 year old girl just happened to be.\nWe are now accustomed to Israeli tactics, and we figure that this is \nthe Israeli way of telling us that \"if you're gonna hurt our soldiers\nyou're gonna pay the price\".  We accept this as a price we have to pay\nto free our land, Israel knows very well that it is not really hurting\nthe resistance that much militarily with these strikes, but rather\njust keeping the pressure on the villagers to demand from their young \nmen to stop attacking Israeli soldiers since these attacks are\ntaking a heavy toll on the lives of the civilian villagers.\nIsrael's retalliation policy is cold hearted, but a reality that\nwe have come to accept and deal with, the Lebanese Resistance\non the other hand is not going to stop its attacks on OCCUPYING \nISRAELI SOLDIERS until they withdraw, this is the only real \nleverage that they have to force Israel to withdraw.\nThe people of South Lebanon are occupied, or shelled by Israel on a \nregular basis.  We do not want to be occupied.  If Israel insists that\nthe so called \"Security Zone\" is necessary for the protection of \nNorthern Israel, than it will have to pay the price of its occupation\nwith the blood of its soldiers.  If Israel is interested in peace,\nthan it should withdraw from OUR land.  We are not asking for the \nestablishment of a Lebanese occupied zone in northern Israel to protect\nour villages that are attacked on a regular basis by Israel, so the\nbest policy seems to be the removal of Israeli occupation and the\nestablishment of peace keeping troops along the border.\n\nI have written before on this very newsgroup, that the only\nreal solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace\nsettlement whereby Israel withdraws to its own borders and\npeace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure\nno one on either side of the border is shelled.\nThis is the only realistic solution, it is time for Israel to\nrealize that the concept of a \"buffer zone\" aimed at protecting\nits northern cities has failed.  In fact it has caused much more\nIsraeli deaths than the occasional shelling of Northern Israel\nwould have resulted in.  \nIf Israel really wants to save some Israeli lives it would withdraw \nunilaterally from the so-called \"Security Zone\" before the conclusion\nof the peace talks.  Such a move would save Israeli lives,\nadvance peace efforts, give Israel a great moral lift, better Israel's \npublic image abroad and give it an edge in the peace negociations \nsince Israel can rightly claim that it is genuinely interested in \npeace and has already offered some important concessions.\nAlong with such a withdrawal Israel could demand that Hizbollah\nbe disarmed by the Lebanese government and warn that it will not \naccept any attacks against its northern cities and that if such a\nshelling occurs than it will consider re-taking the buffer zone\nand will hold the Lebanese and Syrian government responsible for it.\nThere seems to be very little incentive for the Syrian and Lebanese\ngoovernment to allow Hizbollah to bomb Israel proper under such \ncircumstances, and now the Lebanese government has proven that it is\ncapable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did\nin all other parts of Lebanon.\n  \n\nI agree, only in the case of the Isareli soldiers their killing\nCANNOT be qualified as murder, no matter what you say.\n\n I have the feeling that you may be able yourself to make\n\nYes, we have no quarrel with Jews, or Israeli civilians.\nThe real problem is with OCCUPYING Israeli soldiers and those brave\nIsraeli pilots that bomb our civilian villages every time an \noccupying soldier is attacked.\n \n", "\n\n\n\n\tI think the Manta is the European name for the \"GT.\"  I'm pretty sure\nthat the only Kadett's sold here were/are the Pontiac LeMans.

I have a IIsi that came\nwith a Quantum 80 meg drive. When I ran into space problems, I slapped in\nanother 40 meg quantum that I had sitting on a shelf. Here is what I did.\n \nFirst off, I was concerned about space. Since both drives are Quantum\nquarter height drives, I finally decided that the logical place for them\nwas stacked one upon the other. Fine, they fit snugly. (I have not had a\nproblem with heat yet, and these drives have been running together for\nover two months.\n\nThe next problem was connecting the drive. If you have a spare internal\nhard disk power cable as I did, then half of your troubles are over. just\nsplice in the extra cable so that you get one square motherboard\nconnector and two hard disk power connectors. If you don't have a spare\ncable, you will have to buy the wires and connectors which can be found\nin any good electronics store for about $10. I would suggest properly\nsoldering/heatshrinking the connections to reduce the possibility of\nshorts or bad connections.\n\nNext, you need a ribbon cable connection. Again, I had a spare hard disk\nribbon cable, and I wanted to be careful in case this didn't word so what\nI did was purchase a crimp on 50 pin cable connector that gave me another\nmale connector in the middle of my spare cable. The part cost $10 again,\nand is easily attached with any good wood vice. The theory behind using a\ncrimp on connector is that if this doesn't work, my original cable is not\ndamaged, and I can go back to the original setup.\n\nHaving done all that, I couldn't be bothered to check the dev notes for\npower consumption so I plugged it in and it works like a charm to this\nday. \n\nIn a mac II, everything should work the same. Be careful with the ID's of\nthe drive, and ensure that the terminating resistors on both drives are\nintact.

If I\ndon't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.\n\nBut back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a\nlow cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General\nDynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper\nstage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two\nunmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. \nTotal cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.

And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric\ntonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew\nhabitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for\nthe additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be\nable to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,\nthat's a wild ass guess).

The question is,\nis one of the effect dominant, and which one is it? The idea would be to\ndesign an experiment which would seaprate the two characteristics, and\nsee which effect produces a similar result to the one with which those of\nus who have bikes are familiar.\n\nLet's look at the one that, so far, has sparked no controversy on its\nown, gyroscopic precession. To examine this alone, we would have to\nget rid of the contact patch effect, by not allowing the contact patches\nto transmit any force. The wheels and steering mechanism would have to\nremain, and be attached to a vehicle with about the same weight as a bike,\nthrough suspension (so that the wheels transmit forces to the bike the\nsame way) similar to a bikes. An experiment would be to ride a bike along \na dry road to get moving and to get the wheels spinning, then change \nsurfaces to something that won't transmit forces through the contact \npatches, and try a steering manoeuvre to see if the bike leans. It \nprobably would, since some of us know how easy it is to fall down on ice, \nbut we wouldn't get a good idea of how well or what it feels like \nbecause, without the contact patches, we can't turn.  Maybe there's a \nbetter way. Besides, even ice doesn't get rid of the contact patch\nforces altogether, so we'd have to find a really frictionless surface.\nYou'd have to try it again with the wheels locked to really know if it\nwas the rotation that did it.\n\nLooking at the contact-patch effect only, however, is fairly simple.\nNow we have to find a vehicle that gets the about the same magnitude and\ndirection of cantact patch forces as a motorcycle, and transmits them\nabout the same way to the vehicle, but without rotating wheels.\nHow it gets the contact patch forces is irrelevant, we're just looking\nfor something that has contact patches that can go straight and not\nsideways, and skis or skates would do fine. I don't know of any snow-ski\nor skate bikes, but up here we have the Suzuki Wetbike that is arranged\nlike a motorcycle but has fat water skis where there should be wheels.\nI think the propellor is in front of the rear ski, or something like\nthat, but we could try it at a coast to get rid of most of its effect.\nNow I admit that this is second hand info (although I'd love to try\none of these), but the review in the local cycle rag and a guy in\na bike shop that sells them both say that this machine handles very\nmuch like a motorcycle, in that you countersteer it to turn.\nSo we have contact patches that transmit similar forces to a bike's,\na similar suspension arrangement, and no gyroscopes, but we do have\ncountersteering.\n\nConclusion: you don't need gyroscopes to countersteer vehicles that have\nmotorcycle-like contact patch arrangements. We still don't know what\nreal effect the gyroscopes have when they're there, but from my observations\nof how handlebar angle, force, etc. relate to steering in general, I'm \nwilling to bet that they're not the dominant factor in countersteering. \n\nIf you don't like this conclusion, then don't accept it, but my motorcycle's\nbehaviour is consistent with it.

I would even \nsuggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the\ncontext of his political agenda.

It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate\nin N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have\nan Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated\nagenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some\ngroup with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially\nat the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent \non \"Street Stories\" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to \"get \nready fast\", as \"they know we are coming\". I believe this attack continued, \neven tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top \ndown.

I have a Mitsubishi 63 meg Hard Drive, \nand am running Smartdrv (the version that comes with Windows 3.1) on \nit.  I rarely use Windows.  I use a program called Disk Technician \nGold v1.14 to do diagnostics live time on my hard drive.  It works by \nhaving a device driver detect whenever more than one read is \nnecessary for a file, or if there is anything else is wrong with it, \nand minor problems are fully checked out upon rebooting.  My hard \ndrive is notorious for bad sectors.  I usually end up with 8 new bad \nsectors a week.\n \n        Here's what happened:  I ran a program, and DTG broke in with \nan Emergency Warning and recommended I reboot.  It gave me this \nmessage twice before the program was fully loaded.  I exited the program \nand did just this.  DTG went through its bootup process, examining \nfor new errors etc., and a screen popped up and said something about \nsectors for a brief period of time.\n \n        I then went back to the program, executed it again, and the \nexact same error was detected.  I rebooted and tried again, and the \nsame error happened again.  So, I removed DTG from memory, and went \nto the program to see if I could detect anything wrong.  Sure enough \nthere was a number of read attempts.  So I rebooted and reloaded DTG, \nbut removed the cache.  I executed the program.  No read errors, \neither audible or detected by DTG.  I quit the program, loaded the \ncache, and ran the program again.  The errors were detected.\n \n        Ok, so the errors are there, and DTG detects but doesn't fix \nthem, when the cache is loaded.  When the cache is not loaded there are \nno errors.  So, to see if the cache was interfering with any other \nfiles, I went into xtree gold and tagged all files, and searched them \nfor a random string (in other words, I wanted the program to \ncompletely read every file on my hard drive).  Before I got through \nthe c's DTG had detected at least six errors and recommended I reboot.\n \n        Does anybody, have any idea why Smartdrv is causing misreads on \nmy hard drive?  Oh, there are exactly two misreads per file, and 1 in \nabout every 100 files are affected.  \n \n        I originally posted this message to Disk Technician Corp.'s \nsystem, but I figured someone out in netland may know enough about \nsmartdrv to help me out.\n", "\n\n\n:  How about Kirlian imaging ?

I \nmean, it's a classic -- there was an article in the paper today, one \nof the papers I saw, which pretty well summed it up.  They said, you \nknow, this is a -- it's just a political power play.  In the Senate \nthe majority does not rule.  It's not like the country.  It's not \nlike the -- it's not like the House.  If the minority chooses, they \ncan stop majority rule.

There are a \nlot of Republican senators who have told people that they might vote \nfor the stimulus program but there's enormous partisan political \npressure not to do it.  \n\t     \n\t     And, of course, what it means is that in this time when \nno new jobs are being created, even though there seems to be an \neconomic recovery, it means that for political purposes they're \nwilling to deny jobs to places like Baltimore and Dallas and Houston \nand Pittsburgh and Philadelphia and Portland and Seattle.

This finding \nsupports previous conclusions by health  experts that the chance of \ncontracting HIV from a health care  worker is remote.  Three studies in the \nJAMA demonstrate that  thousands of patients were treated by two HIV-positive \nsurgeons  and dentists without becoming infected with the virus.  The  studies \nwere conducted by separate research teams in New  Hampshire, Maryland, and \nFlorida.  Each study started with an  HIV-positive doctor or dentist and \ntested all patients willing to participate.  The New Hampshire study found \nthat none of the  1,174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an  \nHIV-positive orthopedic surgeon contracted HIV.

The OAM is a small division of \nthe NIH, with its budget only at $2  million dollars compared to more than $10 \nbillion for the NIH as  a whole.  In addition, the money for available \nresearch grants is even smaller.  About $500,000 to $600,000 total will be \navailable this year for 10 or 20 grants.  Kaiya Montaocean, of the Center  for \nNatural and Traditional Medicine in Washington, D.C., says  the OAM is afraid \nto become involved in AIDS.  \"They have to look successful and there is no \neasy answer in AIDS,\" she said.    There is also a common perception that the \nOAM will focus on  fields the NIH establishment will find non-threatening, \nsuch as  relaxation techniques and acupuncture.  When the OAM called for  an \nadvisory committee conference of about 120 people last year,  the AIDS \ncommunity was largely missing from the meeting.  In  addition, activists' \ngeneral lack of contact with the Office has  added suspicion that the epidemic \nwill be ignored.  Jon  Greenberg, of ACT-UP/New York, said, \"The OAM advisory \npanel is  composed of practitioners without real research experience.  It  \nwill take them several years to accept the nature of research.\"   \nNevertheless,  Dr. Leanna Standish, research director and AIDS  investigator \nat the Bastyr College of Naturopathic Medicine in  Seattle, said, \"Here is a \nwonderful opportunity to fund AIDS  research.  It's only fair to give the \nOffice time to gel, but  it's up to the public to insist that it's much, much \nmore [than  public relations].\" \n======================================================================   \n\"Herpesvirus Decimates Immune-cell Soldiers\" Science News (04/03/93) Vol. 143, \nNo. 14, P. 215   (Fackelmann, Kathy A.) \n\n     Scientists conducting test tube experiments have found that  herpesvirus-\n6 can attack the human immune system's natural killer cells.  This attack \ncauses the killer cells to malfunction,  diminishing an important component in \nthe immune system's fight  against diseases.  Also, the herpesvirus-6 may be a \nfactor in  immune diseases, such as AIDS.

Scientists previously knew that the natural \nkiller cells of  patients infected with HIV do not work correctly.  Lusso's  \nresearch represents the first time scientists have indicated that natural \nkiller cells are vulnerable to any kind of viral attack,  according to Anthony \nL. Komaroff, a researcher with Harvard  Medical School.  Despite the test-tube \nfindings, scientists are  uncertain whether the same result occurs in the \nbody.  Lusso's  team also found that herpesvirus-6 produces the CD4 receptor  \nmolecule that provides access for HIV.  CD4 T-lymphocytes express this surface \nreceptor, making them vulnerable to HIV's attack.   Researchers concluded that \nherpesvirus-6 cells can exacerbate the affects of HIV. \n\n    ======================================================================   \n                                April 15, 1993 \n     ====================================================================   \n\n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: To the Editor\" Journal of the \nAmerican Medical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Gellert, \nGeorge and Nordenberg, Dale F.) \n\n     All health-care workers are obligated and responsible for not  only \nensuring that politicians understand the dimensions of  certain health \nproblems, but also to be committed to related  policies, write George Gellert \nand Dale F. Nordenberg of the  Orange County Health Care Agency, Santa Ana, \nCalif., and the  Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta, Ga.,  \nrespectively.  Dr. Berkley's editorial on why American doctors  should care \nabout the AIDS epidemic beyond the United States  details several reasons for \nthe concerted interest that all  countries share in combating AIDS.  It should \nbe noted that while AIDS leads in hastening global health interdependence, it \nis not  the only illness doing so.  Diseases such as malaria and many  \nrespiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic \ndevelopment of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations.  \nBerkley mentions the enormous social and  economic impact that AIDS will have \non many developing countries, and the increased need for international \nassistance that will  result.  Berkley also cites the lack of political \naggressiveness  toward the AIDS epidemic in its first decade.  But now there \nis a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in  approach \nto international health and development in general, and  HIV/AIDS in \nparticular.  Vice President Al Gore proposes in his  book \"Earth in the \nBalance\" a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable \ninternational development, with programs to  promote literacy, improve child \nsurvival, and disseminate  contraceptive technology and access throughout the \ndeveloping  world.  If enacted, this change in policy could drastically  \nchange the future of worldwide health. \n====================================================================   \n\"AIDS and Priorities in the Global Village: In Reply\" Journal of the American \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 45\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nMedical Association (04/07/93) Vol. 269,  No. 13, P. 1636  (Berkley, Seth) \n\n     Every nation should tackle HIV as early and aggressively as    possible \nbefore the disease reaches an endemic state, even at a  cost of diverting less \nattention to some other illnesses, writes  Seth Berkley of the Rockefeller \nFoundation in New York, N.Y., in  reply to a letter by Drs. Gellert and \nNordenberg.  Although it is true that diseases other than AIDS, such as \nmalaria and  respiratory and intestinal illnesses, have similarly inhibited  \neconomic development in developing countries and deserve much  more attention \nthan they are getting, Berkley disagrees with the  contention that AIDS is \nreceiving too much attention.  HIV  differs from other diseases, in most \ndeveloping countries because it is continuing to spread.  For most endemic \ndiseases, the  outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another \nyear  of about the same level of needless disease and death.  But with  AIDS \nand its increasing spread, the cost of neglect, not only in  disease burden \nbut financially, is much greater.  Interventions  in the early part of a \nrampantly spreading epidemic like HIV are  highly cost-effective because each \nindividual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission.  Berkley \nsays he agrees  with Gellert and Nordenberg about the gigantic social and  \neconomic effects of AIDS and about the need for political  leadership.  But he \nconcludes that not only is assertive  political leadership needed in the \nUnited States for the AIDS  epidemic, but even more so in developing countries \nwith high  rates of HIV infection and where complacency about the epidemic  \nhas been the rule.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 46\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n                               AIDS/HIV Articles\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n\n            First HIV Vaccine Trial Begins in HIV-Infected Children\n                                H H S   N E W S\n     ********************************************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n                                March 29, 1993\n\n\n        First HIV Vaccine Therapy Trial Begins In HIV-Infected Children\n\n\nThe National Institutes of Health has opened the first trial of experimental \nHIV vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency \nvirus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. \n\nThe trial will compare the safety of three HIV experimental vaccines in 90 \nchildren recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide. Volunteers must be HIV-\ninfected but have no symptoms of HIV disease. \n\nHHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala said this initial study can be seen as \"a \nhopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of HIV-infected \nchildren who now face the certainty they will develop AIDS.\" \n\nAnthony S. Fauci, M.D., director of the National Institute of Allergy and \nInfectious Diseases and of the NIH Office of AIDS Research, said the trial \"is \nthe first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay \ndisease progression in children with HIV who are not yet sick.\"  If these \nvaccines prove to be safe, more sophisticated questions about their \ntherapeutic potential will be assessed in Phase II trials. \n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 10,000 children in \nthe United States have HIV.  By the end of the decade, the World Health \nOrganization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide. \n\nThe study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old.  NIAID, which \nfunds the AIDS Clinical Trials Group network, anticipates conducting the trial \nat nine ACTG sites around  the country and three sites participating in the \nACTG but funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human \nDevelopment. \n\nPreliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows \nthat certain vaccines can boost existing HIV-specific immune responses and \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 47\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nstimulate new ones.  It will be several years, however, before researchers \nknow how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease. \n\nThe results from the pediatric trial, known as ACTG 218, will be examined \nclosely for other reasons as well.  \"This trial will provide the first insight \ninto how the immature immune system responds to candidate HIV vaccines,\" said \nDaniel Hoth, M.D., director of NIAID's division of AIDS.  \"We need this \ninformation to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent \nHIV infection in children.\" \n\nIn the United States, most HIV-infected children live in poor inner-city \nareas, and more than 80 percent are minorities, mainly black or Hispanic. \n\nNearly all HIV-infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during \npregnancy  or at birth.  An infected mother in the United States has more than \na one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby.  As growing \nnumbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to HIV through injection \ndrug use or infected sexual partners, researchers expect a corresponding \nincrease in the numbers of infected children. \n\nHIV disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults.  \nThe most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with HIV \ndevelop a serious AIDS-related infection by 3 to 6 years of age.  These \ninfections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of \nchildhood that can result in seizures, pneumonia, diarrhea and other symptoms \nleading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays. \n\nAt least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger \nto enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older \nparticipants.  All volunteers must have well-documented HIV infection but no \nsymptoms of HIV disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen \nliver or spleen.  They cannot have received any anti-retroviral or immune-\nregulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study. \n\nStudy chair John S. Lambert, M.D., of the University of Rochester Medical \nSchool, and co- chair Samuel Katz, M.D., of Duke University School of \nMedicine, will coordinate the trial assisted by James McNamara, M.D., medical \nofficer in the pediatric medicine branch of NIAID's division of AIDS. \n\n\"We will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children \nfor any side effects, to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or \nfevers, for example, than another,\" said Dr. McNamara.  \"We'll also look at \nwhether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other \nsignificant laboratory or clinical effects.\"   He emphasized that the small \nstudy size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 48\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nproducts. \n\nThe trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from \nrecombinant HIV proteins.  These so-called subunit vaccines, each genetically \nengineered to contain only a piece of the virus, have so far proved well-\ntolerated in ongoing trials in HIV-infected adults. \n\nOne vaccine made by MicroGeneSys Inc. of Meriden, Conn., contains gp160--a \nprotein  that gives rise to HIV's surface proteins--plus alum adjuvant.  \nAdjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine.  Presently, alum is \nthe only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the Food and Drug \nAdministration. \n\nBoth of the other vaccines--one made by Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco \nand the other by Biocine, a joint venture of Chiron and CIBA-Geigy, in \nEmeryville, Calif.--contain the major HIV surface protein, gp120, plus \nadjuvant.  The Genentech vaccine contains alum, while the Biocine vaccine \ncontains MF59, an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in \nother Phase I vaccine trials in adults. \n\nA low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 \nchildren.  Twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the \nexperimental vaccine, and three children will be given adjuvant alone, \nconsidered the placebo.  Neither the health care workers nor the children will \nbe told what they receive. \n\nIf the low dose is well-tolerated, controlled testing of a higher dose of the \nexperimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of 15 children will \nbegin. \n\nEach child will receive six immunizations--one every four weeks for six \nmonths--and be followed-up for 24 weeks after the last immunization.  \n\nFor more information about the trial sites or eligibility for enrollment, call \nthe AIDS Clinical Trials Information Service, 1-800-TRIALS-A, from 9 a.m. to 7 \np.m., EST weekdays.

Although the \nHIV genes were active in the mice, they did not compromise the animals' \nimmunity, the researchers found.  This led them to conclude that the HIV \nitself caused the skin disease. \n\nOur findings support a growing body of evidence that HIV can cause disease \nwithout affecting the immune system, said lead author Dr. Jeffrey Kopp of the \nNational Institute of Dental Research (NIDR).  Dr. Kopp and his colleagues \ndescribed their study in the March issue of AIDS Research and Human \nRetroviruses. \n\nDeveloping animal models of HIV infection has been difficult, since most \nanimals, including mice, cannot be infected by the virus.  To bypass this \nproblem, scientists have developed HIV-transgenic mice, which carry genes for \nHIV as well as their own genetic material. \n\nNIDR scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting HIV genes into mouse \neggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice.  The resulting litters \ncontained both normal and transgenic animals. \n\nInstitute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of HIV \ngenetic material in l988.  Those mice, however, became sick and died too soon \nafter birth to study in depth.  In the present study, the scientists used an \nincomplete copy of HIV, which allowed the animals to live longer. \n\nSome of the transgenic animals developed scaling, wart-like tumors on their \nnecks and backs.  Other transgenic mice developed thickened, crusting skin \nlesions that covered most of their bodies, resembling psoriasis in humans.  No \nskin lesions developed in their normal, non-transgenic littermates. \n\nStudies of tissue taken from the wart-like skin tumors showed that they were a \ntype of noncancerous tumor called papilloma. Although the papillomavirus can \ncause these skin lesions, laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the \nanimals. \n\nTissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the \npresence of a protein-producing molecule made by the HIV genetic material.  \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 50\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nEvidence of HIV protein production proved that the viral genes were \"turned \non,\" or active, said Dr. Kopp. \n\nThe scientists found no evidence, however, of compromised immunity in the \nmice:  no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common \ninfections.  The fact that HIV genes were active but the animals' immune \nsystems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the \nskin lesions, Dr. Kopp said. \n\nFurther proof of HIV gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists \nexposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light.  The light increased HIV \ngenetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin.  \nPapilloma formation in response to increased HIV genetic activity proved the \ngenes were responsible for the skin condition, the scientists said.  No \nlesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the UV light. \n\nThe transgenic mice used in this study were developed at NIDR by Dr. Peter \nDickie, who is now with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases. \n\nCollaborating on the study with Dr. Kopp were Mr. Charles Wohlenberg, Drs. \nNickolas Dorfman, Joseph Bryant, Abner Notkins, and Paul Klotman, all of NIDR; \nDr. Stephen Katz of the National Cancer Institute; and Dr. James Rooney, \nformerly with NIDR and now with Burroughs Wellcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 51\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\n               Clinical Consultation Telephone Service for AIDS\n                                H H S   N E W S\n                 ********************************************\n                 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES\n\n                                 March 4, 1993\n\n\n     HHS Secretary Donna E. Shalala today announced the first nationwide \nclinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care \nprofessionals who have questions about providing care to people with HIV \ninfection or AIDS. \n     The toll-free National HIV Telephone Consulting Service is staffed by a \nphysician, a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist. It provides information on \ndrugs, clinical trials and the latest treatment methods.  The service is \nfunded by the Health Resources and Services Administration and operates out of \nSan Francisco General Hospital. \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"One goal of this project is to share expertise \nso patients get the best care.  A second goal is to get more primary health \ncare providers involved in care for people with HIV or AIDS, which reduces \ntreatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and \ncommunity social support networks.  Currently, many providers refer patients \nwith HIV or AIDS to specialists or other providers who have more experience.\" \n     Secretary Shalala said, \"This clinical expertise should be especially \nhelpful for physicians and providers who treat people with HIV or AIDS in \ncommunities and clinical sites where HIV expertise is not readily available.\" \n     The telephone number for health care professionals is 1-800-933-3413, and \nit is accessible from 10:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. EST (7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST) \nMonday through Friday.  During these times, consultants will try to answer \nquestions immediately, or within an hour.  At other times, physicians and \nhealth care providers can leave an electronic message, and questions will be \nanswered as quickly as possible. \n     Health care professionals may call the service to ask any question \nrelated to providing HIV care, including the latest HIV/AIDS drug treatment \ninformation, clinical trials information, subspecialty case referral, \nliterature searches and other information.  The service is designed for health \ncare professionals rather than patients, families or others who have alternate \nsources of information or materials. \n     When a health care professional calls the new service, the call is taken \nby either a clinical pharmacist, primary care physician or family nurse \npractitioner.  All staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and \ninpatient primary care for people with HIV-related diseases.  The consultant \nasks for patient-specific information, including CD4 cell count, current \nmedications, sex, age and the patient's HIV history. \n     This national service has grown out of a 16-month local effort that \n\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 52\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\n\nresponded to nearly 1,000 calls from health care providers in northern \nCalifornia.  The initial project was funded by HRSA's Bureau of Health \nProfessions, through its Community Provider AIDS Training (CPAT) project, and \nby the American Academy of Family Physicians. \n     \"When providers expand their knowledge, they also improve the quality of \ncare they are able to provide to their patients,\" said HRSA Administrator \nRobert G. Harmon. M.D., M.P.H.  \"This project will be a great resource for \nhealth care professionals and the HIV/AIDS patients they serve.\" \n     \"This service has opened a new means of communication between health care \nprofessionals and experts on HIV care management,\" said HRSA's associate \nadministrator for AIDS and director of the Bureau of Health Resources \nDevelopment, G.

If my experiences say that \"there exists no god\"\nand yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only\ngoing on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal\nrealities.\n\nFurthermore, the trouble with \"feelings and experiences\" is that they\ncan lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I\nam sure that many of Koresh's followers really believed in him but\nI think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.\n\nFinally, how on earth do you come to the conclusion that the physical\nsphere is not self-explanatory when you only rely on the five senses?\n\n\nYou must be using a definition of \"evidence\" that I am not familiar with.\nTo me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that\nwhat you are saying is true.\n\nHowever, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith.\nIt is not something you can share around - others must experience it\nindependantly.

Sounds vaguely similar to a problem I had a long time ago when I was  \ntrying to use Kermit.  I was building a serial connection between my Duo 210  \nand my NeXT.  I think the problem was in the handshaking.  Basically, you need  \nto make sure that the handshaking protocol is the same on both sides.  A safe  \nplace to start is by selecting NO handshaking on either end.  One problem is  \nthat the Zilog serial chip seems to get permanently wedged if you talk to it  \nwrong, and only a reset will clear it.  I don't know the specifics.  But this  \ncould be a nonlinearity that screws up your attempts at debugging the system.   \nIt could very well be that you are doing things right--eventually-- but one  \nwrong move (like trying a bad handshaking protocol) can screw up any further  \ncorrect actions, until the next machine reset.  I have wedged my Mac and also  \nmy NeXT that way.\n\nNow I can send files back and forth between the Duo and the NeXT without any  \nproblem, and at pretty high speeds too.\n\nI don't know what kind of chip the PC uses, but I think the Zilog 8530 is  \npretty standard.", "Another guess to your salvation riddle would be \"saved\".", "patrickd@wpi.WPI.EDU (Lazer) writes ...\n\nSpecs for the 68040 can fill a 500 page book.

I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\nGT.  I decided to buy myself a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runners\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Porsche 924 (1987 model years).\nI narrowed it down to those two.  I liked the simplicity and handling\n(and snob appeal, too) of driving a Porsche.  The Supra Turbo was less\nmoney and had more features and performance - almost a personal luxury\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the 924.\nI was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the 924, but i\ndecided to stop by my insurance agent's office on the way.  I asked\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\n \n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate classification will be the same as\nthe Celica (the '85 Celica was considered a subcompact and for that\nyear was rated as one of the safest cars), with a slight increase because\nthe car will be 2 years newer.  Our lower-risk division will continue\nto handle your account.\n \n\"If you buy the Porsche 924, we'll have to change you to the standard\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\na 944, it's another story again - we'll cover the rest of this year,\nbut cancel you after that.\"\n \n\"But the Supra is much faster than the 924, and the 924 is actually\nfaster than the [standard] 944.  That doens't make sense.\"\n \n That's what the book says.  We don't insure Corvettes, either.  For\nsome reason, the underwriters consider Supras - and their drivers -\nas very traditional and conservative.\"\n \nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of reasons.  The Porsche\ndealer had a nice salesman to get me interested, but a tough high-pressure\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payments, it would have taken\na year longer to pay for the Porsche, plus its higher insurance.

On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire\ncelestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)\nswing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.\n\n2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked\nto the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity\nfrom April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay\nAntenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to\n11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.\n\n3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss\ntimer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.\n\n4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer\n(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received\nproperly.\n\n5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify\nthe health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment\ndata; long term trend analysis is continuing.\n\n6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the\noptimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary\nanalysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation\nindex is near the optimal level.\n\n7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the\nExtreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.\nPreliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.\n\n8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster\nflushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed\nduring the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.\n\n9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant\nchanges (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads\n19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These\nmeasurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special\nanomaly team.\n\n10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:\n\n       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts\n       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin\n       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner\n       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees\n           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)\n       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1\n       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range\n       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,\n           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS\n       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within\n           acceptable range\n       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours\n           Time To Initiation - 260 hours\n\n\nGDS (Ground Data Systems):\n\n1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test\nfor the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21\n(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify\nthe flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller\n(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement\nfor the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry\nrates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry\nSubsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The\n10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was\nnot metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS\ndata from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of\nthe TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.\n\n\nTRAJECTORY\n\n     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory\nstatus was as follows:\n\n\tDistance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)\n\tDistance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)\n\tHeliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour\n\tDistance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km\n\tRound Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds\n\n\nSPECIAL TOPIC", "\nFrankly, no.

Therefore, even if this\nreligion does not take off, its founding members will be very important\nhistorically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become \ncommon.\n\nThe basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional\nmorality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's\naccounts of the facts and historical events is correct.\n\nFor example,\n\nStory of Adam and Eve:\nAdam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited\nsupply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says\nnot to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \nin bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.\n(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in\nthe bushes that might have angered God.)\n\nTraditional Philosophy:\n1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This\nis why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.\n2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \nand slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without \nquestion by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.\n\nInterpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:\nThey were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were\nobligated to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Being forced to leave the \nGarden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.\n\nLessons from Traditional Interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is ideal.  Get-\nting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.\n3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.\n4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and \nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \nthemselves.\n5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from\nlearning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.\n\n1990's philosophy:\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless\nnamed \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\n2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people \n(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.\n\nInterpretation of events based on current philosophy:\nThey were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge\nrather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge\nand (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-\nselves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were \nREWARDED by being allowed into the \"real world.\"\n\nLessons from new interpretation:\n1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.\n2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read \"welfare\") is at best\na temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn\nis ideal.\n3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.\n4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and\nshould consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and \"alter\nor abolish\" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.\n5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge\nbut should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children \nwithout good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better\nlife for their children (and themselves).\n\nI have tentatively named this new philosophy \"The Church of Eveism\" because\nEve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead\nof its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly\na protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek \nknowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the\ndecision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention\nand desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it \nuntil it was actively sought.\n\n---End serious discussion.

Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a\ncontrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of\n\n + Suppose that there are some good men in the city.\n + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked?\n + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing!\n + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?\n\nI am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and\ncan perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as\n\n + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!\n\nThere are those who say that the definition of \"good\" is \"whatever\nGod happens to want.\" But if that is so, then the statement that God\nis good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants.\nThat being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He\nis good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is\npowerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he\ntells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you\ndefy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes\nsense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you\ndon't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to\nGenesis 18 and to Christianity in general.\n\nAny theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any\nfurther discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God)\nmeaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements\nare always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements\nin particular cases about the course of action most likely to\nachieve a good result.\n\nWhen I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in\nhistory, those actions often seem to me very different from what I\nmight expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us.\nMoreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural\nworld, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might\n\"Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of\nthe Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort\nof difficulties that they find in Nature.\")\n\nNow, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an\nargument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God.\nOn the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose\nthat I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every\ntime he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: \"Good move!\nJust what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if\nI were playing.\" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a\nchess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at\nleast some of his moves will have me thinking, \"Now, what do suppose\ninduced him to do that?\" or even, \"Boy, that was a real slip -- he's\njust thrown the game away!\" Similarly, if God understands the\nworkings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that\nsometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.\n\nOne difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the\ncontrols of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess\ngame. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was\ncarelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier.\nHowever, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a\ntime when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did\nnot take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had\nthought.\n\nWith God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total\nresult of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging\nthat I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier\nthan my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.\n\n     *****     *****     *****     *****     *****\n\nIn the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers,\nwho (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell\nhim into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and\nwhen there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his\nfamily. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: \"Do\nnot worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.\"\n\n\n        The history of the Jews is largely a history of events\n   that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued\n   survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But,\n   amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews\n   and of Judaism.\n        The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup\n   of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of\n   the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out\n   of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if\n   they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have\n   intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into\n   their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few\n   generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a\n   disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into\n   the Promised Land.\n        Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered\n   sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea,\n   destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of\n   the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would\n   be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not.\n   Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of\n   assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the\n   worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility\n   cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human\n   sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never\n   again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry.\n   Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the\n   Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them.\n        Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming\n   simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only\n   prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem\n   every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity,\n   with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place\n   of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the\n   Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in\n   danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea,\n   that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the\n   controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish\n   people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge\n   of all humans everywhere.\n        Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by\n   that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather\n   the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined\n   to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and\n   the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might\n   think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not.\n   The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah\n   portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage\n   from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss\n   that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of\n   Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy)\n   were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it\n   had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would\n   probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism\n   saved them.\n\n        [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]\n\n        Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became\n   famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR\n   LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it,\n   everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on\n   stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the\n   studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast\n   Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she\n   later realized that if she had played the screen role, she\n   would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type.\n   It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney\n   offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for\n   it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking\n   at Walt Disney, she said, \"And now, my special thanks to the\n   man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!\" It was the most\n   memorable line of the evening.\n        In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in\n   the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive\n   to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing\n   with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus\n   Epiphanes....\n\nAfter the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him\nprivately and said, \"You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't\nyou?\" He answered, \"If that is an example that came to your mind,\nthen you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not\ntalk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it.\" I assume\nthat he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no\nstate of Israel.\n\nSomeone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion\nthat God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His\npurposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go\non to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He\nstirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and\nthat when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's\nheart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go.\nAnd this raises questions about how an action can be considered\nwicked and at the same time be considered something that God has\nbrought about.\n\nI suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has\na log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log,\ninstead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot\nthat spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers\nthe wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the\nknot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color\nof the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that\nobservers will say: \"How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a\npiece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its\npresence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a\ngreat work of art.\" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was\nlooking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not\ncontained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art,\nbut a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God\nwould still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people,\nbut He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not\nbetrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected\nJesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if\nPilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set\nJesus free, it might appear that there would have been no\nCrucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no\nSalvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If\nJudas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled\nthe world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know\nhow Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its\ninterior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and\njust as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth\ngame agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops\nand had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up\nthe game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is\nnone the less valid).\n\nThus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of\nPilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice\nwas not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's\nplans by behaving justly and courageously.\n\nWhat, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, \"I\nwill harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go\"?\nSome Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet\nwith God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty\nwere not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather\nthat what God was telling Moses was something like this: \"If you see\nthat Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be\ndiscouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My\npurposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and\nlet the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his\nresistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future\nhistorians and theologians will suppose that I would have been\nthrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.\"\n\nTo return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible\nthat the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are\ninstruments of God's will?\n     First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what\nJoseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong.\nThey intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that\ndoes not make them any less subject to just condemnation and\npunishment.\n     Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not\nthe same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had\nrefrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the\ngood He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.", "\n\n | You certainly do not see OTC preparations advertised as such.\n | The only such ridiculous concoctions are nostrums for premenstrual\n | syndrome, ostensibly to treat headache and \"bloating\" simultaneously.\n | They're worthless.\n\n\n | That's not the idea, and no, they don't work.\n\n\tI *believe* there is a known synergism between certain\nanalgesics and caffiene.
