"""
This file contains a range of settings used by the data processing and
ingestion programs. The ingestion uses a number of constant values,
including filenames, filepaths, column names etc., and storing these
values in a single place should make it more straightfoward to update
and maintain the code base.

To help navigation, the values are broken down into sections, with one
section for each major data source or 'governance area'. The structure
is designed to keep string literals to a single place at the top of
the file as much as possible, and then refer to variable names below 
(rather than have the same string literal scattered across the file in
several different places).
